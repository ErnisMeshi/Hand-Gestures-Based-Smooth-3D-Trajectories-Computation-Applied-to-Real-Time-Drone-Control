\section{Tello}
\label{subsec:tello}
Tello is a small quadcopter that features a Vision Positioning System and an onboard camera. Using its advanced flight controller, it can hover in place and is suitable for flying indoors. Tello caputers 5MP photos and stream until 720p live video. Its maximum flight time is approximately 12 minutes (tested in windless conditions at a consistent $15km/h$) and its maximum flight distance id $100m$ \cite[]{djitelloguide}.

\end{figure}

\noindent The Tello can be controlled manually using the virtual joysticks in the Tello app or using a compatible remote controller. It also has various Intelligent Flight Modes that be used to make Tello perform maneuvers automatically. Propeller Guards can be used to reduce the risk of harm or damage people or objects resulting from accidental collisions with Tello aircraft.

\subsection{Tello Command Types and Results}
\label{subsec:tellosdk}
The Tello SDK connects to the aircraft through a Wi-Fi UDP port, allowing users to control the aircraft with text commands. There are Control and Set commands where return "ok" if the command was successful or "error" or an informational result code if the ocmmand failed. There are also Read commands that return the current value of the sub-parameters.

\section{Gazebo}
\label{subsec:gazebo}

% parlare che si Ã¨ lavorato su windows, ma gazebo era in una macchina virtuale con immagine ubuntu.
Gazebo is a 3D simulator, offers the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. Thanks to Gazebo it was possible to launch the 3D trajectory acquired by hand through the webcam on a simulated drone.

\paragraph*{\texttt{Seaborn}} Seaborn \texttt{Python} is a data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. Because seaborn python is built on top of Matplotlib, the graphics can be further tweaked using Matplotlib tools and rendered with any of the Matplotlib backends to generate publication-quality figures.\footnote{\url{http://seaborn.pydata.org/}}.

\paragraph*{\texttt{scikit-learn}} is an open source package that provides simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis, built on \texttt{NumPy}, \texttt{Scipy}, and \texttt{Matplotlib}\footnote{\url{https://scikit-learn.org}}.
