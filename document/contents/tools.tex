\subsection{Frameworks}
\label{subsec:Frameworks}

NumPy is a package for scientific computing that provides support for a range of utilities for linear algebra and matrix manipulation

Pandas is an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools3. We used it in particular for building and working on the datasets generated for training the models.

Matplotlib is a comprehensive package for creating static, animated, and interactive visualisations in Python4.

scikit-learn is a library that provides simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis, built on NumPy, Scipy, and Matplotlib5
