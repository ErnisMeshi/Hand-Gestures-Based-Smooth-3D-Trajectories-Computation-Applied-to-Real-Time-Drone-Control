Working on this thesis has been an enriching experience. I was able to work on a great project that allowed me to put into practice most of the skills acquired in these years of university. I understood how complicated it is to take small steps forward in any area of knowledge day after day. \\

\noindent I am glad to have worked on this thesis and I could not ask for better regarding the support of my advisors: Dr. Alessandro Giusti, Dr. Loris Roveda and Dr. Gianluigi Ciocca. They consistently allowed this paper to be my own work but steered me in the right direction whenever they thought I needed it. \\

\noindent Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents, my girlfriend Maria Grazia and my closest friends Andrea, Salvatore, Guido, Giada, Claudia, Silvia, Leyla and Ivo for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.
