Working on this thesis was an experience that enriched me. I was able to work on a big project that allowed me to put into practice most of the skills acquired in these years of university. I understood how complicated it is to take small steps forward in any area of knowledge day after day. \\

\noindent I am glad I worked on this thesis and I couldn't have asked for better regarding the support of my advisors: Dr. Alessandro Giusti, Dr. Loris Roveda and Dr. Gianluigi Ciocca, they consistently allowed this paper to be my own work but steered me in the right direction whenever they thought I needed it. \\

\noindent Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents, my girlfriend Mariagrazia Capano and my closest friends Andrea Bonfanti, Salvatore Scilipoti, Guido Piscopo, Giada Maino, Claudia Crimella, Silvia Traversa and Ivo Bettini for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.
