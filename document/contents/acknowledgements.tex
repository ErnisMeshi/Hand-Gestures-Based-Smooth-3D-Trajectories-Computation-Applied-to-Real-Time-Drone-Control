I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Dr Alessandro Giusti of the Informatics at Università Svizzera Italiana. The door to Prof. Giusti office was always open whenever I ran into a trouble spot or had a question about my research or writing. He consistently allowed this paper to be my own work, but steered me in the right direction whenever he thought I needed it. \\

\noindent I would also like to thank the experts who were involved in the validation survey for this research project: Dr Loris Roveda. Without their passionate participation and input, the validation survey could not have been successfully conducted. \\

\noindent I would also like to acknowledge Dr Gianluigi Ciocca of the Informatics at Università Bicocca as the second reader of this thesis, and I am gratefully indebted to him for his very valuable comments on this thesis. \\

\noindent Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents, my girlfriend and my closest friends for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.
